# Good-News-
Good News is a blog. It is my first code project ever, after a couple of weeks of coding. The blog is an assignment for the PHP course I am currently taking.  

## Usage
To be able to run the blog on your local computer, you need a solution stack, e.g. MAMP. In your solution stack, set the root directory to the repository of "Good-News-". Open a browser and go to "localhost:8888".
